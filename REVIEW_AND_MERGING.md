# Review and Merging Rules

## Pull Request Review Process

1. **Assign Reviewers**:
   - Pull requests (PRs) should be assigned to at least two reviewers.
   - Reviewers should be selected based on their expertise and familiarity with the codebase.

2. **Review Criteria**:
   - **Code Quality**: Ensure the code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.
   - **Functionality**: Verify that the code works as intended and meets the requirements.
   - **Security**: Assess the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
   - **Performance**: Check for any performance implications of the changes.
   - **Documentation**: Ensure that the code is well-documented and any relevant documentation is updated.

3. **Review Timeline**:
   - Reviews should be completed within three business days of the PR being assigned.
   - If a reviewer is unable to complete the review in time, they should communicate this and reassign the review if necessary.

4. **Feedback and Changes**:
   - Reviewers should provide clear and constructive feedback.
   - The author of the PR should address all feedback and make the necessary changes.
   - Once changes are made, the PR should be re-reviewed by the original reviewers.

## Merging Process

1. **Passing CI/CD Checks**:
   - All PRs must pass the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) checks before merging.
   - Ensure that all tests pass and there are no build errors.

2. **Approve Reviews**:
   - A PR can only be merged after it has been approved by at least two reviewers.
   - If there are any unresolved comments or requested changes, they must be addressed before merging.

3. **Merge Strategy**:
   - Use the "Squash and Merge" strategy to combine all commits into a single commit before merging.
   - Ensure that the commit message is clear and descriptive.

4. **Post-Merge Actions**:
   - After merging, ensure that any relevant documentation is updated.
   - Communicate the merge to the team and stakeholders if necessary.
   - Monitor the merged changes for any issues in the production environment.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Conflict Resolution**: If there are merge conflicts, the author of the PR is responsible for resolving them.
- **Code Owners**: Certain files or directories may have designated code owners who must review and approve changes.
- **Emergency Fixes**: For critical issues that require immediate attention, bypassing the standard review process may be allowed with team lead approval.
